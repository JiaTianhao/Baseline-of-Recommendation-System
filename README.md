**NeuRec** is a flexible and comprehensive library including a variety of state-of-the-art neural recommender models. It aims to solve general and sequential (ie., next-item ) recommendation task. Current version includes 20+ neural recommendation models, and more will be be expected in the near future. NeuRec is free software (open source software), it can be used and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

<h2>Architecture of NeuRec</h2>

<img src="architecture.jpg" width = "50%" height = "50%"/>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Written in python and easily executed in multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.</li>
  
<li><b>Rich State-of-The-Arts</b>: More than 20 neural recommender models have been implemented, eg., DeepMF, NeuMF, ConvNCF, IRGAN,APR, CFGAN, MultiVAE and more representative models will be continuously added in the NeuRec.
  
<li><b>Flexible Configuration</b>: Configs a recommendation model only using a configuration file, including any loss & optimizer.</li>

<li><b>Easy Expansion</b>: Well-designed interfaces, automatic differentiation.</li>
<li><b>Fast Execution</b>: Naturally supports GPU, multi-thread evaluator. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Our framework can be compiled on Python 3.6+ environments with the following modules installed:
<ul>
<li>tensorflow1.12.0+</li>
<li>numpy1.15.4+</li>
<li>scipy1.1.0+</li>
</ul>
These requirements may be satisified with an updated Anaconda environment as well - https://www.anaconda.com/

<h2>How to run it</h2>

1. The format of the data in the dataset file should be UIRT, ie., [userid,itemid,rating,Unix timestamp]<br>
2. Configure the global file **neurec.properties** and the specific file **XX.properties** in the directory named conf (XX means the name of the specific model).<br>
3. Train and evaluate the specific model (strongly suggest running this project on GPU, which is faster than on CPU):

```
python main.py
```
<h2>Implement your own model</h2>
Implementing your own model in NeuRec needs to inherit AbstractRecommender class. And you need to implement the abstract methods in the abstract class. 

```
1. __init__()
2. build_graph()   
3. train_model()   
4. predict() 
```
